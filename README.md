## LittleJS Starter Kit

Based on KilledByAPixel's [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS) Hello World Starter Game

## Other Considerations:

 *  Multiple tile/sprite sets
 *  Global, scoped timers & clocks
 *  Global, scoped vars
 *  Common library functions (see also gameEffects.js from the LittleJS platformer example)
